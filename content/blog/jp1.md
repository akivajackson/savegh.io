 ### Blossoms from the Dust: A model for salvation
 A close reading of Rainer Maria Rilke's poem _Dich wundert nicht des Sturmes Wucht_ (You are not surprised at the force of the storm).

<tr>
    <td>—You are not surprised at the force of the storm
you have seen it growing.
The trees flee. Their flight
sets the boulevards streaming. And you know: 
he whom they flee is the one
you move toward. All your senses 
sing him, as you stand at the window.
</td>

    <td>Dich wundert nicht des Sturmes Wucht, –
du hast ihn wachsen sehn; –
die Bäume flüchten. Ihre Flucht
schafft schreitende Alleen.
Da weißt du, der, vor dem sie fliehn,
ist der, zu dem du gehst,
und deine Sinne singen ihn,
wenn du am Fenster stehst.</td>

> You are not surprised at the force of the storm  <br>you have seen it growing.  <br>The trees flee. Their flight  <br>sets the boulevards streaming. And you know:   <br>he whom they flee is the one  <br>you move toward. All your senses   <br>sing him, as you stand at the window.<br>  <br>The weeks stood still in summer.  <br>The trees’ blood rose. Now you feel  <br>it wants to sink back  <br>into the source of everything. You thought   <br>you could trust that power  <br>when you plucked the fruit:  <br>now it becomes a riddle again  <br>and you again a stranger.  <br>  <br>Summer was like your house: you knew  <br>where each thing stood.  <br>Now you must go out into your heart   <br>as onto a vast plain. Now   <br>the immense loneliness begins.  <br>The days go numb, the wind  <br>sucks the world from your senses like withered leaves.  <br>  <br>Through the empty branches the sky remains.   <br>It is what you have.  <br>Be earth now, and evensong.  <br>Be the ground lying under that sky.  <br>Be modest now, like a thing  <br>ripened until it is real,  <br>so that he who began it all  <br>can feel you when he reaches for you.<br>
