My second independent project in college: analyzing how the German translation of Morris Rosenfeld's Yiddish sweatshop poetry changd it from a messianic work into political zionist poems. 

Plus some analysis of awesome art deco drawings by E.M. Lilien, like the one above!

P.S. Lilien, that guy who drew the illustrations to the book, also took this famous photo of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism

However, this drawing made its way into _Lieder des Ghetto_. See a resemblance?
