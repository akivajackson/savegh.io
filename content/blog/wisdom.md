So I'm getting my wisdom teeth out this week. The hygenist and two oral surgeons recommended I get them out, but you know what? Did I trust them? Well, sorta. 

But my grandpa was a dentist who specialized in TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction), a sucky disorder that you can get from wisdom tooth extraction. And I didn't have any problems yet—the surgeons just thought they might come up down the line. So I was wary. 

## RCTs 
My first step was to try to look at the literature. Well, [almost 85% of Americans](https://blog.edentalsolutions.com/the-history-of-wisdom-teeth-removal-in-america#:~:text=The%20wisdom%20teeth%20removal%20percentage,population%20of%20currently%20employed%20Americans.) get their wisdom teeth extracted at some point—might make you think there's good research on it, right? 

> While symptomatic or diseased impacted wisdom teeth should be recommended for removal, current evidence neither refutes nor confirms the practice of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth.<!-- <br>...<br>We do not know whether active surveillance is effective for asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth, as we found no RCTs or prospective cohort studies on this topic. -->[^1]

Well, that meta-analysis mentioned something about Swedes, not sure I should trust it. What about this one?

`Ghaeminia H, Perry J, Nienhuijs MEL, Toedtling V, Tummers M, Hoppenreijs TJM, Van der Sanden WJM, Mettes TG.`*`Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth.`*`Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2016`  
This will definitely help, right? Eight researchers searched six medical databases for published, ongoing, and unpublished studies in any language for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs, and found a grand total of...two.
>No eligible studies in this review reported the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth on health‐related quality of life.[^2]

<!-- add info about no difference in dental score -->
So we have no RCT evidence, which seems a little rough. 

But this doesn't mean we're fine. There must be a reason so many people get them out? One scary paper goes through all the terrible things that can happen if you don't get them out, and concludes: 

> There may always be a debate regarding the removal of asymptomatic wisdom teeth but, on
scientific review of many related articles, one becomes acutely aware that asymptomatic often does not
mean there is no disease present when discussing retained wisdom teeth or third molars.[^3]

## The Spreadsheet
So I did my usual thing, and spent too much time making a spreadsheet. 

At the top are all the risks of removal, and below are all the risks of keeping the wisdom teeth. The columns contain my best guess at likelihood from the literature (see below for sources), how long the problem is likely to last, and my guesstimate of how much money that discomfort is worth to me (aka how much I would pay to not have it).

<!-- doesn't work with anything other than slides -->

<!-- for some reason the shortcode d-oesn't work but the html does -->
<!-- {{< gsheets "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGpmDUxSIipW0g4-bTmhmPVGB5j04w_BWp6xyyFyMFKe7DDn9116WPqy3S_5JKNU857jOS30JzZs7f/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" >}} -->

Seems pretty clear that I should keep them. But then I was looking at prices of dental procedures after I get kicked off my parent's insurance next year, and a conservative 40% likelihood of getting them taken out later,[^4] multiplied by the cost if my insurance has double the current copay(which seems likely), raises the cost of keeping them by $1800 * 2 * .4 = $1440, which tips the scale in favor of taking them out. 

But really, my wisdom teeth aren't asymptomatic. They've been accumulating gunk and sometimes feel a little icky. While I don't have high confidence that I'm making the right choice, it seems like there is not much evidence either way, so I'll be letting someone hammer away at my mouth on Thursday.
